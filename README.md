# Zarv Engineering Challenges

Welcome to our Engineering Challenge repository üññ

If you found this repository it probably means that you are participating in our recruitment process. Thank you for your time and energy. If that's not the case please take a look at our [openings](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zarv/jobs/) and apply!

This is an opportunity for us both to work together and get to know each other in a more technical way. If you have any questions please [open and issue](https://github.com/zarvhq/challenges/issues/new) and we'll reach out to help.

## Before you start coding, read this! üòé

Before jumping right into implementation we advise you to think about the solution first. We will evaluate, not only if your solution works but also the following aspects:

- Simple and easy to read code. Remember that simple is not easy
- Comment your code. The easier it is to understand the complex parts, the faster and more positive the feedback will be
- Include a README.md that briefly describes how to build and run your code, as well as how to test it
- Be consistent in your code.
- Feel free to, in your solution, include some your considerations while doing this challenge. We want you to solve this challenge in the language you feel most comfortable with. Our machines run Python (3.7.x or higher) or NodeJS (16.18.x or higher). If you are thinking of using any other programming language please reach out to us first üôè.

**Good luck** and may the Force be with you! üëäüèº
